The leadership and his vision led the bureaucracy to anticipate and forecast the different scenarios and prepared itself to respond well and in time. Further the entire cost of testing to treatment was borne by Government and therefore people, particularly poor and vulnerable never hesitated to come Covid hospitals for early treatment. This helped in reducing mortality and reduced need for more ICUs. Oxygen availability was well planned and meticulously monitored. Strong leadership, intuitive planning, meticulous monitoring and effective feedback generation improved quality of care and management. ",

Nonetheless, the government focussed on patting it's back instead of preparing for the Second Wave, even though rest of the world had started facing it. As a result, UP saw horryfying scenes of entire families being wiped out. Young, earning members of the family died in large numbers. Number of COVID deaths were actively kept secret by administration, on the informal directions of State Government. Complete apathy to the common man's suffering. Even the so-called VIPs were helpless; MLAs and senior IAS officers died. An example of unpreparedness is the fact that Lucknow, the State capital, with three government medical universities and numerous private hospitals, had only one oxygen plant, which was also supplying oxygen in cities as far as Prayagraj. This level of callousness is nothing short of murder. ",

One of the grave problems is that public opinion is ill-informed and impulsive. This has a bearing in the kind of politics and the two act in tandem.     Our focus and demand have not been towards a better infrastructure suited to our times and the threats that lie in the shadows. Many a times we waste our efforts in areas which are sub optimal to strengthen the society and infrastructure.    We have created a leviathan of the system but there is no focus or dedicated effort to optimise it nor to weed out plethora of problems that is plaguing the system and it's functions. We IAS officers can run the system well and are second to none however we are at times so stifled and constrained by the systemic demands, compulsions, resistance and other faults. In fact there is a lot to be done. COVID pandemic has exposed several systemic flaws but will we bite the bullet. Very soon we will forget it as we have a very small chache of short term memory. We will again engage ourselves with feudal demands with wasteful, passionate debates on the factors and topics which have no contribution in India's modernisation and these will become the manifesto of coming elections. And the problems of infrastructure and the problems in system will be forgotten.    It's high time that we apply the economic principles on the resources that we apply. The objective here can not be profit, but outcomes. Very strict accountability should be implemented and we as a nation, as the fraternity of bureaucrats should come together and weed out the faults now or we may collapse or loose credibility. In fact there should be a debate to discuss problems with all earnesty and honesty and there should be a sincere effort to rectify.

Even it doesn’t indicate that it’s a team work through a process of consensus building. The impression I get is that the person at the helm brings crazy ideas in the morning every day and wants them implemented without even realising and seeking follow up on what happened to instructions that were given before. Better options, alternate implementable options within the present system are ab initio shunned. Pandemic needed least interference from top. It was a public health issue and not a law and order one. In a country where rule of law and civic sense is at a premium, IEC (information, education and communication) by public health experts 24x7 would have been better than one person’s idiosyncratic ideas. My fear and worry is that the civil services to the larger extent succumbed to crazy ideas of one and the only one resulting into knee jerk, defensive response to a pandemic. There was no freedom for any proactive act barring a few exceptions.  When the person at top plays the role of “all in one”, others really do not matter and any comparison therefore has its own limitations. I end here on my reflections. ",hempande@hotmail.com

The role of bureaucrats especially IAS officers was very critical. We were able to deliver so much inspite of all the shortcomings. Many valuable lives were lost but so many more were saved. There were days where oxygen supply and medicines were monitored on hourly basis and even few minutes of delay, many souls would have been lost. We made sure that every resource, including human resource of various departments were put into action to manage the pandemic.   Still Policy makers should have consulted ground level officers more before arriving at a decision. It would have made few things easier.
